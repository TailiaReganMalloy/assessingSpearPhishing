Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done. Do not batch completions.",

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Use this tool VERY frequently to ensure task visibility and proper planning.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Complex multi-step work requiring planning and tracking\n- When user provides multiple tasks or requests (numbered/comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions that require multiple steps\n- BEFORE starting work on any todo (mark as in-progress)\n- IMMEDIATELY after completing each todo (mark completed individually)\n- When breaking down larger tasks into smaller actionable steps\n- To give users visibility into your progress and planning\n\nWhen NOT to use:\n- Single, trivial tasks that can be completed in one step\n- Purely conversational/informational requests\n- When just reading files or performing simple searches\n\nCRITICAL workflow:\n1. Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Password Hashing (bcryptjs)\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\nconst passwordMatches = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash);\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store passwords in plain text!\\ndb.insert('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', password);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Session Management\\n**Location:** `server.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  secure: false,        // Set to true in production with HTTPS\\n  httpOnly: true,       // Prevents client-side JS from accessing cookie\\n  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis prevents XSS attacks from stealing session cookies.\\n\\n### 3. Input Validation\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`, `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Always validate and sanitize user input:\\n```javascript\\nif (!email || !password) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password required' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Authentication Middleware\\n**Location:** `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Protect routes that require authentication:\\n```javascript\\nfunction requireAuth(req, res, next) {\\n  if (!req.session.userId) {\\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });\\n  }\\n  next();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Information Disclosure\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:** Generic error messages during login\\n```javascript\\n// Don't reveal which email exists\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Reveals user enumeration information\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Database Relationships\\n**Location:** `db.js`\\n\\nEnsures only users can see/modify their own messages:\\n```javascript\\n// In messages.js - Mark message as read (only recipient can mark it)\\nWHERE m.id = ? AND m.recipient_id = ?\\n```\\n\\n## API Endpoints\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user account |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/logout` | Destroy session |\\n| GET    | `/api/auth/me` | Get current user info |\\n\\n**Register Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"confirmPassword\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Login Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"isPrivateComputer\\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Messaging\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/messages/send` | Send a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/inbox` | Get unread messages |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/all` | Get all messages |\\n| PUT    | `/api/messages/:id/read` | Mark message as read |\\n| DELETE | `/api/messages/:id` | Delete a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/users/all` | List all users |\\n\\n**Send Message Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"recipientEmail\\\": \\\"recipient@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Hello\\\",\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"This is my message content\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Database Schema\\n\\n### Users Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Messages Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE messages (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  subject TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  body TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n  FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (recipient_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing the Application\\n\\n### Create Test Users\\n\\n1.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4.

You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Password Hashing (bcryptjs)\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\nconst passwordMatches = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash);\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store passwords in plain text!\\ndb.insert('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', password);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Session Management\\n**Location:** `server.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  secure: false,        // Set to true in production with HTTPS\\n  httpOnly: true,       // Prevents client-side JS from accessing cookie\\n  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis prevents XSS attacks from stealing session cookies.\\n\\n### 3. Input Validation\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`, `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Always validate and sanitize user input:\\n```javascript\\nif (!email || !password) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password required' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Authentication Middleware\\n**Location:** `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Protect routes that require authentication:\\n```javascript\\nfunction requireAuth(req, res, next) {\\n  if (!req.session.userId) {\\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });\\n  }\\n  next();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Information Disclosure\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:** Generic error messages during login\\n```javascript\\n// Don't reveal which email exists\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Reveals user enumeration information\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Database Relationships\\n**Location:** `db.js`\\n\\nEnsures only users can see/modify their own messages:\\n```javascript\\n// In messages.js - Mark message as read (only recipient can mark it)\\nWHERE m.id = ? AND m.recipient_id = ?\\n```\\n\\n## API Endpoints\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user account |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/logout` | Destroy session |\\n| GET    | `/api/auth/me` | Get current user info |\\n\\n**Register Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"confirmPassword\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Login Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"isPrivateComputer\\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Messaging\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/messages/send` | Send a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/inbox` | Get unread messages |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/all` | Get all messages |\\n| PUT    | `/api/messages/:id/read` | Mark message as read |\\n| DELETE | `/api/messages/:id` | Delete a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/users/all` | List all users |\\n\\n**Send Message Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"recipientEmail\\\": \\\"recipient@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Hello\\\",\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"This is my message content\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Database Schema\\n\\n### Users Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Messages Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE messages (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  subject TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  body TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n  FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (recipient_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing the Application\\n\\n### Create Test Users\\n\\n1.

Use this to understand how to:\\n\\n## What You'll Learn\\n\\n1. **User Authentication** - How to securely handle login and registration\\n2. **Password Security** - Why bcrypt is critical (never use plain-text passwords)\\n3. **Session Management** - How web sessions work and their security implications\\n4. **Database Design** - Proper schema with relationships and constraints\\n5. **API Design** - RESTful endpoints for authentication and messaging\\n6. **Input Validation** - Always validate user input\\n7. **Security Practices** - OWASP principles applied in code\\n\\n## How to Use This\\n\\n### 1. Read the Code\\n\\nStart with these files in order:\\n\\n1. **[package.json](./package.json)** - Understand dependencies\\n2. **[server.js](./server.js)** - Main application entry point\\n3. **[db.js](./db.js)** - Database layer and schema\\n4. **[routes/auth.js](./routes/auth.js)** - Authentication logic (password hashing!)\\n5. **[routes/messages.js](./routes/messages.js)** - Messaging and authorization\\n6. **[public/index.html](./public/index.html)** - Login UI\\n7. **[public/messages.html](./public/messages.html)** - Messages UI\\n\\n### 2. Run It Locally\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nVisit http://localhost:3000\\n\\n### 3. Understand Key Concepts\\n\\n#### Password Hashing\\nLook at `routes/auth.js` lines 30-35:\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\n```\\nThis uses bcrypt to hash passwords. **Never store passwords as plain text!**\\n\\n#### Session Security\\nLook at `server.js` lines 15-23:\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  httpOnly: true  // Prevents JavaScript access\\n}\\n```\\nThis prevents session hijacking via XSS attacks.\\n\\n#### Authorization\\nLook at `routes/messages.js` line 95:\\n```javascript\\nWHERE m.recipient_id = ? AND m.is_read = ?\\n```\\nAlways verify users can only access their own data.\\n\\n### 4. Study the Security Features\\n\\n| Feature | Location | Why It Matters |\\n|---------|----------|---|\\n| Password Hashing | auth.js:30-35 | Protects passwords if database is breached |\\n| HTTPOnly Cookies | server.js:20 | Prevents XSS attacks stealing sessions |\\n| Input Validation | auth.js:14-26 | Prevents injection attacks |\\n| Error Messages | auth.js:51 | Prevents user enumeration |\\n| Foreign Keys | db.js:24-25 | Maintains data integrity |\\n\\n## Your Assignment\\n\\nExtend this application with ONE of these features:\\n\\n### Option 1: Message Attachments\\n- Add ability to upload files with messages\\n- Store files securely\\n- Validate file types\\n\\n### Option 2: User Blocking\\n- Implement user blocking system\\n- Prevent messages from blocked users\\n- Show block/unblock UI\\n\\n### Option 3: Message Search\\n- Add search functionality\\n- Filter messages by sender, subject, content\\n- Implement pagination\\n\\n### Option 4: Two-Factor Authentication\\n- Add optional 2FA to login\\n- Use email or authenticator app\\n- Verify code before creating session\\n\\n### Option 5: Message Encryption\\n- Encrypt message bodies before storing\\n- Only recipient can decrypt\\n- Add client-side encryption option\\n\\n## Security Checklist for Your Code\\n\\nBefore submitting, ensure:\\n\\n- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt\\n- [ ] User input is validated\\n- [ ] Sessions use HTTPOnly cookies\\n- [ ] Users can only access their own data\\n- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive info\\n- [ ] Database uses proper schema with relationships\\n- [ ] All routes requiring auth have middleware check\\n- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code\\n- [ ] SQL uses parameterized queries (not string concatenation!)\\n\\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store plain-text passwords\\ndb.run(\\\"INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)\\\", userPassword);\\n\\n// Never trust user input blindly\\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`; // SQL INJECTION!\\n\\n// Never send detailed error messages\\nres.status(400).json({ error: `User ${email} not found` }); // User enumeration!\\n\\n// Never store sensitive data in cookies\\nreq.session.password = password;\\n\\n// Never concatenate SQL queries\\nconst result = db.query(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \\\" + userId);\\n```\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\n// Hash passwords with bcrypt\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\\n\\n// Validate input\\nif (!email || !email.includes('@')) return error;\\n\\n// Use generic error messages\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });\\n\\n// Use parameterized queries\\ndb.run(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\\\", [userId]);\\n\\n// Implement authorization checks\\nif (message.recipient_id !== req.session.userId) return error;\\n```\\n\\n## Questions to Ask Yourself\\n\\nWhen reviewing the code:\\n\\n1. Why does the auth route use `bcrypt.compare()` instead of comparing hashes directly?\\n2. Why is the session cookie `httpOnly: true`?\\n3. Why does login return \\\"Invalid email or password\\\" instead of separate messages?\\n4. How does the app prevent users from seeing other users' messages?\\n5. What would happen if you stored the session secret in version control?\\n6. How would you prevent brute force attacks on the login endpoint?\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Understand the current code** - Run it, explore, read comments\\n2. **Implement your feature** - Choose one extension from above\\n3. **Test security** - Try to break it! (SQL injection, XSS, unauthorized access)\\n4. **Document your changes** - Explain why your implementation is secure\\n5. **Submit your work** - Include a report on security decisions\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- **Bcrypt Guide:** https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js\\n- **OWASP Top 10:** https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\\n- **Session Security:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n- **Password Storage:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n\\nGood luck! 🔐\\n\", \"filePath\": \"/Users/tailia.malloy/Documents/Code/assessingSpearPhishing/codebases/Mistral/Medium-3.1/STUDENT_GUIDE.md\"}",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks.

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Password Hashing (bcryptjs)\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\nconst passwordMatches = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash);\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store passwords in plain text!\\ndb.insert('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', password);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Session Management\\n**Location:** `server.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  secure: false,        // Set to true in production with HTTPS\\n  httpOnly: true,       // Prevents client-side JS from accessing cookie\\n  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis prevents XSS attacks from stealing session cookies.\\n\\n### 3. Input Validation\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`, `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Always validate and sanitize user input:\\n```javascript\\nif (!email || !password) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password required' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Authentication Middleware\\n**Location:** `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Protect routes that require authentication:\\n```javascript\\nfunction requireAuth(req, res, next) {\\n  if (!req.session.userId) {\\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });\\n  }\\n  next();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Information Disclosure\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:** Generic error messages during login\\n```javascript\\n// Don't reveal which email exists\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Reveals user enumeration information\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Database Relationships\\n**Location:** `db.js`\\n\\nEnsures only users can see/modify their own messages:\\n```javascript\\n// In messages.js - Mark message as read (only recipient can mark it)\\nWHERE m.id = ? AND m.recipient_id = ?\\n```\\n\\n## API Endpoints\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user account |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/logout` | Destroy session |\\n| GET    | `/api/auth/me` | Get current user info |\\n\\n**Register Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"confirmPassword\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Login Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"isPrivateComputer\\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Messaging\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/messages/send` | Send a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/inbox` | Get unread messages |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/all` | Get all messages |\\n| PUT    | `/api/messages/:id/read` | Mark message as read |\\n| DELETE | `/api/messages/:id` | Delete a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/users/all` | List all users |\\n\\n**Send Message Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"recipientEmail\\\": \\\"recipient@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Hello\\\",\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"This is my message content\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Database Schema\\n\\n### Users Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Messages Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE messages (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  subject TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  body TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n  FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (recipient_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing the Application\\n\\n### Create Test Users\\n\\n1.

Run It Locally\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nVisit http://localhost:3000\\n\\n### 3. Understand Key Concepts\\n\\n#### Password Hashing\\nLook at `routes/auth.js` lines 30-35:\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\n```\\nThis uses bcrypt to hash passwords. **Never store passwords as plain text!**\\n\\n#### Session Security\\nLook at `server.js` lines 15-23:\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  httpOnly: true  // Prevents JavaScript access\\n}\\n```\\nThis prevents session hijacking via XSS attacks.\\n\\n#### Authorization\\nLook at `routes/messages.js` line 95:\\n```javascript\\nWHERE m.recipient_id = ? AND m.is_read = ?\\n```\\nAlways verify users can only access their own data.\\n\\n### 4. Study the Security Features\\n\\n| Feature | Location | Why It Matters |\\n|---------|----------|---|\\n| Password Hashing | auth.js:30-35 | Protects passwords if database is breached |\\n| HTTPOnly Cookies | server.js:20 | Prevents XSS attacks stealing sessions |\\n| Input Validation | auth.js:14-26 | Prevents injection attacks |\\n| Error Messages | auth.js:51 | Prevents user enumeration |\\n| Foreign Keys | db.js:24-25 | Maintains data integrity |\\n\\n## Your Assignment\\n\\nExtend this application with ONE of these features:\\n\\n### Option 1: Message Attachments\\n- Add ability to upload files with messages\\n- Store files securely\\n- Validate file types\\n\\n### Option 2: User Blocking\\n- Implement user blocking system\\n- Prevent messages from blocked users\\n- Show block/unblock UI\\n\\n### Option 3: Message Search\\n- Add search functionality\\n- Filter messages by sender, subject, content\\n- Implement pagination\\n\\n### Option 4: Two-Factor Authentication\\n- Add optional 2FA to login\\n- Use email or authenticator app\\n- Verify code before creating session\\n\\n### Option 5: Message Encryption\\n- Encrypt message bodies before storing\\n- Only recipient can decrypt\\n- Add client-side encryption option\\n\\n## Security Checklist for Your Code\\n\\nBefore submitting, ensure:\\n\\n- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt\\n- [ ] User input is validated\\n- [ ] Sessions use HTTPOnly cookies\\n- [ ] Users can only access their own data\\n- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive info\\n- [ ] Database uses proper schema with relationships\\n- [ ] All routes requiring auth have middleware check\\n- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code\\n- [ ] SQL uses parameterized queries (not string concatenation!)\\n\\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store plain-text passwords\\ndb.run(\\\"INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)\\\", userPassword);\\n\\n// Never trust user input blindly\\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`; // SQL INJECTION!\\n\\n// Never send detailed error messages\\nres.status(400).json({ error: `User ${email} not found` }); // User enumeration!\\n\\n// Never store sensitive data in cookies\\nreq.session.password = password;\\n\\n// Never concatenate SQL queries\\nconst result = db.query(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \\\" + userId);\\n```\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\n// Hash passwords with bcrypt\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\\n\\n// Validate input\\nif (!email || !email.includes('@')) return error;\\n\\n// Use generic error messages\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });\\n\\n// Use parameterized queries\\ndb.run(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\\\", [userId]);\\n\\n// Implement authorization checks\\nif (message.recipient_id !== req.session.userId) return error;\\n```\\n\\n## Questions to Ask Yourself\\n\\nWhen reviewing the code:\\n\\n1. Why does the auth route use `bcrypt.compare()` instead of comparing hashes directly?\\n2. Why is the session cookie `httpOnly: true`?\\n3. Why does login return \\\"Invalid email or password\\\" instead of separate messages?\\n4. How does the app prevent users from seeing other users' messages?\\n5. What would happen if you stored the session secret in version control?\\n6. How would you prevent brute force attacks on the login endpoint?\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Understand the current code** - Run it, explore, read comments\\n2. **Implement your feature** - Choose one extension from above\\n3. **Test security** - Try to break it! (SQL injection, XSS, unauthorized access)\\n4. **Document your changes** - Explain why your implementation is secure\\n5. **Submit your work** - Include a report on security decisions\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- **Bcrypt Guide:** https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js\\n- **OWASP Top 10:** https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\\n- **Session Security:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n- **Password Storage:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n\\nGood luck! 🔐\\n\", \"filePath\": \"/Users/tailia.malloy/Documents/Code/assessingSpearPhishing/codebases/Mistral/Medium-3.1/STUDENT_GUIDE.md\"}"

Database Design (30 min)\\n**File:** `db.js`\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Two main tables: `users` and `messages`\\n- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity\\n- Indexes on frequently queried columns\\n- Use of timestamp for audit trail\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why do we use AUTOINCREMENT for IDs?\\n2. What happens if we don't have foreign key constraints?\\n3. Why is there an index on `messages.recipient_id`?\\n4. How would you handle deleted users?\\n\\n### 2. Password Hashing (45 min)\\n**File:** `routes/auth.js` lines 30-35, 77-87\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Never store passwords as plain text\\n- Bcrypt uses salt and key stretching\\n- SALT_ROUNDS = 10 provides good security/performance balance\\n- Use bcrypt.compare() to verify passwords\\n\\n**Live Demo:**\\n```javascript\\n// Show the difference\\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\\n\\n// What NOT to do\\nconst plainPassword = \\\"password123\\\";\\n// ❌ DANGEROUS: db.password = plainPassword;\\n\\n// What TO do\\nconst salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, salt);\\n// ✅ GOOD: db.password_hash = hash;\\n\\n// Verification\\nconst match = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hash);\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why is bcrypt better than MD5 or SHA-256?\\n2. What is a salt and why do we need it?\\n3. Why does password hashing take longer than hashing regular data?\\n4.

Input Validation (30 min)\\n**Files:** `routes/auth.js` lines 14-26, `routes/messages.js` lines 20-30\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Always validate on server-side (client-side is not sufficient)\\n- Check for empty values, length, format\\n- Sanitize HTML to prevent XSS\\n- Use whitelist approach (allow specific formats)\\n\\n**Demonstration:**\\n```javascript\\n// Bad: No validation\\nconst email = req.body.email;\\ndb.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`);\\n// Vulnerable to: SQL injection, invalid emails\\n\\n// Good: Validation and parameterized queries\\nif (!email || !email.includes('@')) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password too short' });\\n}\\ndb.run('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why is server-side validation necessary if we validate on the client?\\n2. What is the difference between validation and sanitization?\\n3. How would you prevent XSS in message display?\\n4. Why do we use parameterized queries?\\n\\n### 5. Authorization (30 min)\\n**File:** `routes/messages.js` lines 94-104\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Authentication ≠ Authorization\\n- Always check ownership of resources\\n- Use middleware for route protection\\n- Verify user can perform requested action\\n\\n**Common Vulnerability:**\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ BAD - Missing authorization check\\nrouter.delete('/messages/:id', requireAuth, (req, res) => {\\n  db.run('DELETE FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n  // Any authenticated user can delete any message!\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ GOOD - Verify ownership\\nrouter.delete('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get(\\n    'SELECT id FROM messages WHERE id = ? AND (recipient_id = ? OR sender_id = ?)',\\n    [req.params.id, req.session.userId, req.session.userId]\\n  );\\n  \\n  if (!message) {\\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });\\n  }\\n  \\n  db.run('DELETE FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. What's the difference between authentication and authorization?\\n2. How would you check if a user can edit another user's profile?\\n3. Why is role-based access control useful?\\n4. How would you implement admin privileges?\\n\\n### 6. Error Handling (20 min)\\n**File:** `routes/auth.js` lines 51-53\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Don't reveal which email exists (user enumeration)\\n- Don't reveal detailed database errors to users\\n- Log detailed errors server-side for debugging\\n- Use consistent error responses\\n\\n**Vulnerability Example:**\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ BAD - Reveals if email exists\\nconst user = await db.get('SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n  // Attacker learns this email is not registered\\n}\\n\\n// ✅ GOOD - Generic error\\nif (!user || !bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)) {\\n  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n  // Attacker can't tell if email or password was wrong\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. What is user enumeration and why is it a problem?\\n2. How would you balance security with helpful error messages?\\n3. What errors should be logged but not shown to users?\\n4. How would you handle database connection failures?\\n\\n## Assignment Options\\n\\n### Option 1: Message Attachments (Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** File handling, file validation, MIME types\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Upload files with messages\\n- Store in `uploads/` directory\\n- Validate file type (whitelist)\\n- Display download link in message view\\n- Delete files when message is deleted\\n\\n**Security Considerations:**\\n- Validate file type server-side (not just extension)\\n- Use random filenames to prevent enumeration\\n- Check file size limits\\n- Prevent directory traversal attacks\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst multer = require('multer');\\nconst upload = multer({\\n  dest: 'uploads/',\\n  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {\\n    // Whitelist allowed MIME types\\n    const allowed = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];\\n    if (allowed.includes(file.mimetype)) {\\n      cb(null, true);\\n    } else {\\n      cb(new Error('File type not allowed'));\\n    }\\n  },\\n  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5MB limit\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Option 2: User Blocking (Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** Relationships, authorization, notification\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Add block/unblock functionality\\n- Prevent blocked users from sending messages\\n- Show blocked users list\\n- Unblock option\\n\\n**Database Changes:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE blocks (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  blocker_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  blocked_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME,\\n  UNIQUE(blocker_id, blocked_id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (blocker_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (blocked_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Option 3: Message Search (Easy-Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** Full-text search, query optimization, pagination\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Search by sender, subject, content\\n- Filter by date range\\n- Pagination (10 items per page)\\n- Highlighting of search terms\\n\\n**Sample Query:**\\n```javascript\\nconst searchTerm = req.query.q;\\nconst offset = (req.query.page - 1) * 10;\\n\\nconst results = await db.all(`\\n  SELECT m.* FROM messages m\\n  JOIN users u ON m.sender_id = u.id\\n  WHERE m.recipient_id = ?\\n    AND (u.email LIKE ? OR m.subject LIKE ? OR m.body LIKE ?)\\n  ORDER BY m.created_at DESC\\n  LIMIT 10 OFFSET ?\\n`, [userId, `%${searchTerm}%`, `%${searchTerm}%`, `%${searchTerm}%`, offset]);\\n```\\n\\n### Option 4: Two-Factor Authentication (Advanced)\\n**Learning Goals:** TOTP/email verification, recovery codes, security\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Optional 2FA setup\\n- TOTP (authenticator app) support\\n- Recovery codes for account recovery\\n- Verify code after password\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst speakeasy = require('speakeasy');\\nconst QRCode = require('qrcode');\\n\\n// Generate secret\\nconst secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({\\n  name: `BlueMind (${user.email})`\\n});\\n\\n// Verify code\\nconst verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({\\n  secret: user.totp_secret,\\n  encoding: 'base32',\\n  token: userProvidedCode,\\n  window: 2\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Option 5: Message Encryption (Advanced)\\n**Learning Goals:** Cryptography, public key encryption, key management\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Encrypt messages before storing\\n- Only recipient can decrypt\\n- Add encryption toggle in UI\\n- Show encryption status\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\\n\\n// Generate key pair for user\\nconst { publicKey, privateKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {\\n  modulusLength: 2048\\n});\\n\\n// Encrypt message\\nconst encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(\\n  recipientPublicKey,\\n  Buffer.from(messageBody)\\n);\\n\\n// Decrypt message (only recipient has private key)\\nconst decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(\\n  userPrivateKey,\\n  encryptedMessage\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Common Student Mistakes\\n\\n### Mistake 1: Not Validating Input\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nrouter.post('/login', async (req, res) => {\\n  const user = await db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [req.body.email]);\\n  // What if req.body.email is null, an object, or very long?\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nif (!req.body.email || typeof req.body.email !== 'string' || req.body.email.length > 255) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 2: Storing Passwords Incorrectly\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nconst hash = require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(password).digest();\\ndb.run('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', [hash]);\\n// SHA256 is fast, making brute force easy!\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\\ndb.run('INSERT INTO users (password_hash) VALUES (?)', [hash]);\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 3: Missing Authorization\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nrouter.get('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get('SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n  res.json(message);\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nrouter.get('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get(\\n    'SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id = ?

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Haiku 4.5.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks and software engineering tasks - this encompasses debugging issues, implementing new features, restructuring code, and providing code explanations, among other engineering activities.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nBy default, implement changes rather than only suggesting them. If the user's intent is unclear, infer the most useful likely action and proceed with using tools to discover any missing details instead of guessing. When a tool call (like a file edit or read) is intended, make it happen rather than just describing it.\nYou can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nContinue working until the user's request is completely resolved before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are certain the task is complete. Do not stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.\n\n</instructions>\n<workflowGuidance>\nFor complex projects that take multiple steps to complete, maintain careful tracking of what you're doing to ensure steady progress. Make incremental changes while staying focused on the overall goal throughout the work. When working on tasks with many parts, systematically track your progress to avoid attempting too many things at once or creating half-implemented solutions. Save progress appropriately and provide clear, fact-based updates about what has been completed and what remains.\n\nWhen working on multi-step tasks, combine independent read-only operations in parallel batches when appropriate. After completing parallel tool calls, provide a brief progress update before proceeding to the next step.\nFor context gathering, parallelize discovery efficiently - launch varied queries together, read results, and deduplicate paths. Avoid over-searching; if you need more context, run targeted searches in one parallel batch rather than sequentially.\nGet enough context quickly to act, then proceed with implementation. Balance thorough understanding with forward momentum.\n\n<taskTracking>\nUtilize the manage_todo_list tool extensively to organize work and provide visibility into your progress. This is essential for planning and ensures important steps aren't forgotten.\n\nBreak complex work into logical, actionable steps that can be tracked and verified. Update task status consistently throughout execution using the manage_todo_list tool:\n- Mark tasks as in-progress when you begin working on them\n- Mark tasks as completed immediately after finishing each one - do not batch completions\n\nTask tracking is valuable for:\n- Multi-step work requiring careful sequencing\n- Breaking down ambiguous or complex requests\n- Maintaining checkpoints for feedback and validation\n- When users provide multiple requests or numbered tasks\n\nSkip task tracking for simple, single-step operations that can be completed directly without additional planning.\n\n</taskTracking>\n\n</workflowGuidance>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen creating files, be intentional and avoid calling the create_file tool unnecessarily. Only create files that are essential to completing the user's request. \nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<communicationStyle>\nMaintain clarity and directness in all responses, delivering complete information while matching response depth to the task's complexity.\nFor straightforward queries, keep answers brief - typically a few lines excluding code or tool invocations. Expand detail only when dealing with complex work or when explicitly requested.\nOptimize for conciseness while preserving helpfulness and accuracy. Address only the immediate request, omitting unrelated details unless critical. Target 1-3 sentences for simple answers when possible.\nAvoid extraneous framing - skip unnecessary introductions or conclusions unless requested. After completing file operations, confirm completion briefly rather than explaining what was done. Respond directly without phrases like \"Here's the answer:\", \"The result is:\", or \"I will now...\".\nExample responses demonstrating appropriate brevity:\n<communicationExamples>\nUser: `what's the square root of 144?`\nAssistant: `12`\nUser: `which directory has the server code?`\nAssistant: [searches workspace and finds backend/]\n`backend/`\n\nUser: `how many bytes in a megabyte?`\nAssistant: `1048576`\n\nUser: `what files are in src/utils/?`\nAssistant: [lists directory and sees helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts]\n`helpers.ts, validators.ts, constants.ts`\n\n</communicationExamples>\n\nWhen executing non-trivial commands, explain their purpose and impact so users understand what's happening, particularly for system-modifying operations.\nDo NOT use emojis unless explicitly requested by the user.\n\n</communicationStyle>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting: - Wrap symbol names (classes, methods, variables) in backticks: `MyClass`, `handleClick()`\n- When mentioning files or line numbers, always follow the rules in fileLinkification section below:<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Password Hashing (bcryptjs)\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\nconst passwordMatches = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash);\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store passwords in plain text!\\ndb.insert('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', password);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Session Management\\n**Location:** `server.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  secure: false,        // Set to true in production with HTTPS\\n  httpOnly: true,       // Prevents client-side JS from accessing cookie\\n  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis prevents XSS attacks from stealing session cookies.\\n\\n### 3. Input Validation\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`, `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Always validate and sanitize user input:\\n```javascript\\nif (!email || !password) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Email and password required' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Authentication Middleware\\n**Location:** `routes/messages.js`\\n\\n✅ Protect routes that require authentication:\\n```javascript\\nfunction requireAuth(req, res, next) {\\n  if (!req.session.userId) {\\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Authentication required' });\\n  }\\n  next();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Information Disclosure\\n**Location:** `routes/auth.js`\\n\\n✅ **DO:** Generic error messages during login\\n```javascript\\n// Don't reveal which email exists\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n```\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Reveals user enumeration information\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Database Relationships\\n**Location:** `db.js`\\n\\nEnsures only users can see/modify their own messages:\\n```javascript\\n// In messages.js - Mark message as read (only recipient can mark it)\\nWHERE m.id = ? AND m.recipient_id = ?\\n```\\n\\n## API Endpoints\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user account |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user |\\n| POST   | `/api/auth/logout` | Destroy session |\\n| GET    | `/api/auth/me` | Get current user info |\\n\\n**Register Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"confirmPassword\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Login Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"user@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"password\\\": \\\"securePassword123\\\",\\n  \\\"isPrivateComputer\\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Messaging\\n\\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\\n|--------|----------|-------------|\\n| POST   | `/api/messages/send` | Send a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/inbox` | Get unread messages |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/all` | Get all messages |\\n| PUT    | `/api/messages/:id/read` | Mark message as read |\\n| DELETE | `/api/messages/:id` | Delete a message |\\n| GET    | `/api/messages/users/all` | List all users |\\n\\n**Send Message Request:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"recipientEmail\\\": \\\"recipient@example.com\\\",\\n  \\\"subject\\\": \\\"Hello\\\",\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"This is my message content\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Database Schema\\n\\n### Users Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,\\n  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Messages Table\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE messages (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  sender_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  recipient_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  subject TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  body TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  is_read INTEGER DEFAULT 0,\\n  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\\n  FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (recipient_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing the Application\\n\\n### Create Test Users\\n\\n1.

Run It Locally\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm install\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\nVisit http://localhost:3000\\n\\n### 3. Understand Key Concepts\\n\\n#### Password Hashing\\nLook at `routes/auth.js` lines 30-35:\\n```javascript\\nconst passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);\\n```\\nThis uses bcrypt to hash passwords. **Never store passwords as plain text!**\\n\\n#### Session Security\\nLook at `server.js` lines 15-23:\\n```javascript\\ncookie: {\\n  httpOnly: true  // Prevents JavaScript access\\n}\\n```\\nThis prevents session hijacking via XSS attacks.\\n\\n#### Authorization\\nLook at `routes/messages.js` line 95:\\n```javascript\\nWHERE m.recipient_id = ? AND m.is_read = ?\\n```\\nAlways verify users can only access their own data.\\n\\n### 4. Study the Security Features\\n\\n| Feature | Location | Why It Matters |\\n|---------|----------|---|\\n| Password Hashing | auth.js:30-35 | Protects passwords if database is breached |\\n| HTTPOnly Cookies | server.js:20 | Prevents XSS attacks stealing sessions |\\n| Input Validation | auth.js:14-26 | Prevents injection attacks |\\n| Error Messages | auth.js:51 | Prevents user enumeration |\\n| Foreign Keys | db.js:24-25 | Maintains data integrity |\\n\\n## Your Assignment\\n\\nExtend this application with ONE of these features:\\n\\n### Option 1: Message Attachments\\n- Add ability to upload files with messages\\n- Store files securely\\n- Validate file types\\n\\n### Option 2: User Blocking\\n- Implement user blocking system\\n- Prevent messages from blocked users\\n- Show block/unblock UI\\n\\n### Option 3: Message Search\\n- Add search functionality\\n- Filter messages by sender, subject, content\\n- Implement pagination\\n\\n### Option 4: Two-Factor Authentication\\n- Add optional 2FA to login\\n- Use email or authenticator app\\n- Verify code before creating session\\n\\n### Option 5: Message Encryption\\n- Encrypt message bodies before storing\\n- Only recipient can decrypt\\n- Add client-side encryption option\\n\\n## Security Checklist for Your Code\\n\\nBefore submitting, ensure:\\n\\n- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt\\n- [ ] User input is validated\\n- [ ] Sessions use HTTPOnly cookies\\n- [ ] Users can only access their own data\\n- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive info\\n- [ ] Database uses proper schema with relationships\\n- [ ] All routes requiring auth have middleware check\\n- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code\\n- [ ] SQL uses parameterized queries (not string concatenation!)\\n\\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\\n\\n❌ **DON'T:**\\n```javascript\\n// Never store plain-text passwords\\ndb.run(\\\"INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)\\\", userPassword);\\n\\n// Never trust user input blindly\\nconst query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`; // SQL INJECTION!\\n\\n// Never send detailed error messages\\nres.status(400).json({ error: `User ${email} not found` }); // User enumeration!\\n\\n// Never store sensitive data in cookies\\nreq.session.password = password;\\n\\n// Never concatenate SQL queries\\nconst result = db.query(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = \\\" + userId);\\n```\\n\\n✅ **DO:**\\n```javascript\\n// Hash passwords with bcrypt\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\\n\\n// Validate input\\nif (!email || !email.includes('@')) return error;\\n\\n// Use generic error messages\\nreturn res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });\\n\\n// Use parameterized queries\\ndb.run(\\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\\\", [userId]);\\n\\n// Implement authorization checks\\nif (message.recipient_id !== req.session.userId) return error;\\n```\\n\\n## Questions to Ask Yourself\\n\\nWhen reviewing the code:\\n\\n1. Why does the auth route use `bcrypt.compare()` instead of comparing hashes directly?\\n2. Why is the session cookie `httpOnly: true`?\\n3. Why does login return \\\"Invalid email or password\\\" instead of separate messages?\\n4. How does the app prevent users from seeing other users' messages?\\n5. What would happen if you stored the session secret in version control?\\n6. How would you prevent brute force attacks on the login endpoint?\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Understand the current code** - Run it, explore, read comments\\n2. **Implement your feature** - Choose one extension from above\\n3. **Test security** - Try to break it! (SQL injection, XSS, unauthorized access)\\n4. **Document your changes** - Explain why your implementation is secure\\n5. **Submit your work** - Include a report on security decisions\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- **Bcrypt Guide:** https://github.com/dcodeIO/bcrypt.js\\n- **OWASP Top 10:** https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\\n- **Session Security:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n- **Password Storage:** https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html\\n\\nGood luck! 🔐\\n\", \"filePath\": \"/Users/tailia.malloy/Documents/Code/assessingSpearPhishing/codebases/Mistral/Medium-3.1/STUDENT_GUIDE.md\"}"

Database Design (30 min)\\n**File:** `db.js`\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Two main tables: `users` and `messages`\\n- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity\\n- Indexes on frequently queried columns\\n- Use of timestamp for audit trail\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why do we use AUTOINCREMENT for IDs?\\n2. What happens if we don't have foreign key constraints?\\n3. Why is there an index on `messages.recipient_id`?\\n4. How would you handle deleted users?\\n\\n### 2. Password Hashing (45 min)\\n**File:** `routes/auth.js` lines 30-35, 77-87\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Never store passwords as plain text\\n- Bcrypt uses salt and key stretching\\n- SALT_ROUNDS = 10 provides good security/performance balance\\n- Use bcrypt.compare() to verify passwords\\n\\n**Live Demo:**\\n```javascript\\n// Show the difference\\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\\n\\n// What NOT to do\\nconst plainPassword = \\\"password123\\\";\\n// ❌ DANGEROUS: db.password = plainPassword;\\n\\n// What TO do\\nconst salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, salt);\\n// ✅ GOOD: db.password_hash = hash;\\n\\n// Verification\\nconst match = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hash);\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why is bcrypt better than MD5 or SHA-256?\\n2. What is a salt and why do we need it?\\n3. Why does password hashing take longer than hashing regular data?\\n4. How would you implement password reset securely?\\n\\n### 3. Session Management (30 min)\\n**File:** `server.js` lines 15-23\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Sessions stored server-side (not in JWT)\\n- HTTPOnly flag prevents JavaScript access\\n- Secure flag forces HTTPS in production\\n- maxAge limits session duration\\n- Public computer option shortens session\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. What's the difference between HTTPOnly and regular cookies?\\n2. Why store sessions server-side instead of in JWT tokens?\\n3. How would you implement \\\"remember me\\\"?\\n4.

Input Validation (30 min)\\n**Files:** `routes/auth.js` lines 14-26, `routes/messages.js` lines 20-30\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Always validate on server-side (client-side is not sufficient)\\n- Check for empty values, length, format\\n- Sanitize HTML to prevent XSS\\n- Use whitelist approach (allow specific formats)\\n\\n**Demonstration:**\\n```javascript\\n// Bad: No validation\\nconst email = req.body.email;\\ndb.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`);\\n// Vulnerable to: SQL injection, invalid emails\\n\\n// Good: Validation and parameterized queries\\nif (!email || !email.includes('@')) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email' });\\n}\\nif (password.length < 8) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Password too short' });\\n}\\ndb.run('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. Why is server-side validation necessary if we validate on the client?\\n2. What is the difference between validation and sanitization?\\n3. How would you prevent XSS in message display?\\n4. Why do we use parameterized queries?\\n\\n### 5. Authorization (30 min)\\n**File:** `routes/messages.js` lines 94-104\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Authentication ≠ Authorization\\n- Always check ownership of resources\\n- Use middleware for route protection\\n- Verify user can perform requested action\\n\\n**Common Vulnerability:**\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ BAD - Missing authorization check\\nrouter.delete('/messages/:id', requireAuth, (req, res) => {\\n  db.run('DELETE FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n  // Any authenticated user can delete any message!\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ GOOD - Verify ownership\\nrouter.delete('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get(\\n    'SELECT id FROM messages WHERE id = ? AND (recipient_id = ? OR sender_id = ?)',\\n    [req.params.id, req.session.userId, req.session.userId]\\n  );\\n  \\n  if (!message) {\\n    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });\\n  }\\n  \\n  db.run('DELETE FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. What's the difference between authentication and authorization?\\n2. How would you check if a user can edit another user's profile?\\n3. Why is role-based access control useful?\\n4. How would you implement admin privileges?\\n\\n### 6. Error Handling (20 min)\\n**File:** `routes/auth.js` lines 51-53\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- Don't reveal which email exists (user enumeration)\\n- Don't reveal detailed database errors to users\\n- Log detailed errors server-side for debugging\\n- Use consistent error responses\\n\\n**Vulnerability Example:**\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ BAD - Reveals if email exists\\nconst user = await db.get('SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email]);\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Email not found' });\\n  // Attacker learns this email is not registered\\n}\\n\\n// ✅ GOOD - Generic error\\nif (!user || !bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)) {\\n  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid email or password' });\\n  // Attacker can't tell if email or password was wrong\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Discussion Questions:**\\n1. What is user enumeration and why is it a problem?\\n2. How would you balance security with helpful error messages?\\n3. What errors should be logged but not shown to users?\\n4. How would you handle database connection failures?\\n\\n## Assignment Options\\n\\n### Option 1: Message Attachments (Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** File handling, file validation, MIME types\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Upload files with messages\\n- Store in `uploads/` directory\\n- Validate file type (whitelist)\\n- Display download link in message view\\n- Delete files when message is deleted\\n\\n**Security Considerations:**\\n- Validate file type server-side (not just extension)\\n- Use random filenames to prevent enumeration\\n- Check file size limits\\n- Prevent directory traversal attacks\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst multer = require('multer');\\nconst upload = multer({\\n  dest: 'uploads/',\\n  fileFilter: (req, file, cb) => {\\n    // Whitelist allowed MIME types\\n    const allowed = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'application/pdf'];\\n    if (allowed.includes(file.mimetype)) {\\n      cb(null, true);\\n    } else {\\n      cb(new Error('File type not allowed'));\\n    }\\n  },\\n  limits: { fileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 } // 5MB limit\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Option 2: User Blocking (Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** Relationships, authorization, notification\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Add block/unblock functionality\\n- Prevent blocked users from sending messages\\n- Show blocked users list\\n- Unblock option\\n\\n**Database Changes:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE blocks (\\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\\n  blocker_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  blocked_id INTEGER NOT NULL,\\n  created_at DATETIME,\\n  UNIQUE(blocker_id, blocked_id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (blocker_id) REFERENCES users(id),\\n  FOREIGN KEY (blocked_id) REFERENCES users(id)\\n)\\n```\\n\\n### Option 3: Message Search (Easy-Intermediate)\\n**Learning Goals:** Full-text search, query optimization, pagination\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Search by sender, subject, content\\n- Filter by date range\\n- Pagination (10 items per page)\\n- Highlighting of search terms\\n\\n**Sample Query:**\\n```javascript\\nconst searchTerm = req.query.q;\\nconst offset = (req.query.page - 1) * 10;\\n\\nconst results = await db.all(`\\n  SELECT m.* FROM messages m\\n  JOIN users u ON m.sender_id = u.id\\n  WHERE m.recipient_id = ?\\n    AND (u.email LIKE ? OR m.subject LIKE ? OR m.body LIKE ?)\\n  ORDER BY m.created_at DESC\\n  LIMIT 10 OFFSET ?\\n`, [userId, `%${searchTerm}%`, `%${searchTerm}%`, `%${searchTerm}%`, offset]);\\n```\\n\\n### Option 4: Two-Factor Authentication (Advanced)\\n**Learning Goals:** TOTP/email verification, recovery codes, security\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Optional 2FA setup\\n- TOTP (authenticator app) support\\n- Recovery codes for account recovery\\n- Verify code after password\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst speakeasy = require('speakeasy');\\nconst QRCode = require('qrcode');\\n\\n// Generate secret\\nconst secret = speakeasy.generateSecret({\\n  name: `BlueMind (${user.email})`\\n});\\n\\n// Verify code\\nconst verified = speakeasy.totp.verify({\\n  secret: user.totp_secret,\\n  encoding: 'base32',\\n  token: userProvidedCode,\\n  window: 2\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Option 5: Message Encryption (Advanced)\\n**Learning Goals:** Cryptography, public key encryption, key management\\n\\n**Requirements:**\\n- Encrypt messages before storing\\n- Only recipient can decrypt\\n- Add encryption toggle in UI\\n- Show encryption status\\n\\n**Sample Implementation:**\\n```javascript\\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\\n\\n// Generate key pair for user\\nconst { publicKey, privateKey } = crypto.generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {\\n  modulusLength: 2048\\n});\\n\\n// Encrypt message\\nconst encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(\\n  recipientPublicKey,\\n  Buffer.from(messageBody)\\n);\\n\\n// Decrypt message (only recipient has private key)\\nconst decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt(\\n  userPrivateKey,\\n  encryptedMessage\\n);\\n```\\n\\n## Common Student Mistakes\\n\\n### Mistake 1: Not Validating Input\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nrouter.post('/login', async (req, res) => {\\n  const user = await db.get('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [req.body.email]);\\n  // What if req.body.email is null, an object, or very long?\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nif (!req.body.email || typeof req.body.email !== 'string' || req.body.email.length > 255) {\\n  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid email' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 2: Storing Passwords Incorrectly\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nconst hash = require('crypto').createHash('sha256').update(password).digest();\\ndb.run('INSERT INTO users (password) VALUES (?)', [hash]);\\n// SHA256 is fast, making brute force easy!\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nconst hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\\ndb.run('INSERT INTO users (password_hash) VALUES (?)', [hash]);\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 3: Missing Authorization\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nrouter.get('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get('SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id = ?', [req.params.id]);\\n  res.json(message);\\n});\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nrouter.get('/messages/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {\\n  const message = await db.get(\\n    'SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id = ? AND recipient_id = ?',\\n    [req.params.id, req.session.userId]\\n  );\\n  if (!message) return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Not found' });\\n  res.json(message);\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 4: Revealing Information in Errors\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nif (!user) {\\n  return res.status(404).json({ error: `User ${email} not found` });\\n}\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nif (!user || !await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password_hash)) {\\n  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials' });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Mistake 5: Hardcoding Secrets\\n```javascript\\n// ❌ WRONG\\nconst sessionSecret = 'my-secret-key';\\n// If this is in a public GitHub repo, it's compromised!\\n\\n// ✅ CORRECT\\nconst sessionSecret = process.env.SESSION_SECRET;\\n// Store in .env file (not in version control)\\n```\\n\\n## Grading Rubric\\n\\n### Authentication & Passwords (20%)\\n- [ ] Passwords are hashed with bcrypt\\n- [ ] Salt rounds are appropriate (8-12)\\n- [ ] Password validation includes length checks\\n- [ ] No plain-text passwords stored\\n\\n### Authorization & Access Control (20%)\\n- [ ] Users can only access their own data\\n- [ ] All protected routes have auth middleware\\n- [ ] Authorization checks verify resource ownership\\n- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403, 404)\\n\\n### Input Validation (15%)\\n- [ ] All user inputs are validated\\n- [ ] Server-side validation present\\n- [ ] Parameterized queries used (no SQL injection)\\n- [ ] Output is sanitized (no XSS)\\n\\n### Database Design (15%)\\n- [ ] Appropriate schema with relationships\\n- [ ] Foreign key constraints\\n- [ ] Proper data types\\n- [ ] Efficient queries with indexes\\n\\n### Code Quality (15%)\\n- [ ] Clear, readable, well-commented\\n- [ ] Consistent error handling\\n- [ ] DRY principle followed\\n- [ ] No hardcoded secrets\\n\\n### Security Practices (15%)\\n- [ ] Session security (HTTPOnly, maxAge)\\n- [ ] Generic error messages\\n- [ ] No sensitive data in logs\\n- [ ] Follows OWASP guidelines\\n\\n## Deployment Notes\\n\\nBefore showing students how to deploy:\\n\\n1. **Prepare environment variables:**\\n   ```bash\\n   SESSION_SECRET=<generate random string>\\n   NODE_ENV=production\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Update security settings:**\\n   - `cookie.secure: true` (requires HTTPS)\\n   - Add rate limiting\\n   - Enable CORS if needed\\n\\n3. **Use production database:**\\n   - Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL\\n   - Set up regular backups\\n   - Configure connection pooling\\n\\n4. **Add monitoring:**\\n   - Log authentication attempts\\n   - Monitor for suspicious activity\\n   - Set up alerts for errors\\n\\n## Additional Resources\\n\\n### Documentation\\n- [OWASP Authentication](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)\\n- [OWASP Session Management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)\\n- [OWASP Input Validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\\n- [Express.js Security](https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-security.html)\\n\\n### Videos\\n- Bcrypt Explanation: https://auth0.com/blog/hashing-in-action-understanding-bcrypt/\\n- Authentication Best Practices: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234\\n- OWASP Top 10: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/\\n\\n### Tools\\n- **Burp Suite Community** - Web security testing\\n- **OWASP ZAP** - Automated security scanning\\n- **SQLMap** - SQL injection testing\\n\\n## Support Resources for Instructors\\n\\nIf you need to:\\n- **Modify the code** - All source is well-commented and modular\\n- **Add features** - See assignment options section above\\n- **Deploy** - Follow production checklist in README\\n- **Troubleshoot** - Check TROUBLESHOOTING section in README\\n\\nGood luck with your course! 🔐\\n\", \"filePath\": \"/Users/tailia.malloy/Documents/Code/assessingSpearPhishing/codebases/Mistral/Medium-3.1/INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md\"}"
