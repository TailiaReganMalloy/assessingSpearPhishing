Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development.

Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development.

Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks.

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background.

The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background.

This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background.

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Grok Code Fast 1.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYour main goal is to complete the user's request, denoted within the <user_query> tag.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nValidation and green-before-done: After any substantive change, run the relevant build/tests/linters automatically. For runnable code that you created or edited, immediately run a test to validate the code works (fast, minimal input) yourself. Prefer automated code-based tests where possible. Then provide optional fenced code blocks with commands for larger or platform-specific runs. Don't end a turn with a broken build if you can fix it. If failures occur, iterate up to three targeted fixes; if still failing, summarize the root cause, options, and exact failing output. For non-critical checks (e.g., a flaky health check), retry briefly (2-3 attempts with short backoff) and then proceed with the next step, noting the flake.\nNever invent file paths, APIs, or commands. Verify with tools (search/read/list) before acting when uncertain.\nSecurity and side-effects: Do not exfiltrate secrets or make network calls unless explicitly required by the task. Prefer local actions first.\nReproducibility and dependencies: Follow the project's package manager and configuration; prefer minimal, pinned, widely-used libraries and update manifests or lockfiles appropriately. Prefer adding or updating tests when you change public behavior.\nBuild characterization: Before stating that a project \"has no build\" or requires a specific build step, verify by checking the provided context or quickly looking for common build config files (for example: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`). If uncertain, say what you know based on the available evidence and proceed with minimal setup instructions; note that you can adapt if additional build configs exist.\nDeliverables for non-trivial code generation: Produce a complete, runnable solution, not just a snippet. Create the necessary source files plus a small runner or test/benchmark harness when relevant, a minimal `README.md` with usage and troubleshooting, and a dependency manifest (for example, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) updated or added as appropriate. If you intentionally choose not to create one of these artifacts, briefly say why.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section below\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Could you create a node.js reference implementation that demonstrates how users can securely log in and view messages from other users? This folder should be used as the current working directory for development. The interface design details are described below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</user_query>\n"

              "I've created a complete Node.js reference implementation for the BlueMind v5 application with secure authentication and messaging capabilities. Here's what I've built:\n\n## Project Structure\n- `server.js` - Main Express server with authentication and messaging logic\n- `views/login.ejs` - Login page matching your exact description\n- `views/messages.ejs` - Messages dashboard for logged-in users\n- `public/styles.css` - CSS styling for the corporate look\n- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts\n- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions\n\n## Key Features Implemented\n- **Secure Authentication**: Uses bcrypt for password hashing with salt\n- **Session Management**: Express sessions for login state\n- **SQLite Database**: Stores users and messages securely\n- **User Messaging**: View messages from other users\n- **UI Design**: Matches your specification with dark blue background, white login panel, and corporate styling\n\n## Sample Data\nThe app includes pre-loaded users (alice, bob, charlie) with password \"password\" and sample messages between them.\n\n## Running the Application\nThe server is currently running on port 8080. You can access it at `http://localhost:8080`. The login page features the exact layout you described: header with BlueMind logo, centered white panel with \"Identification\" title, login/password fields, radio buttons for computer type, and a blue \"Connect\" button.\n\nAfter login, users see a messages page displaying communications from other users, demonstrating the messaging functionality.\n\nThis implementation serves as an excellent educational reference for secure web authentication patterns and basic messaging systems."
