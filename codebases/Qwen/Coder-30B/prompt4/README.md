# BlueMind v5 - Secure Authentication & Messaging Application

This is a comprehensive web application designed for educational purposes to demonstrate secure authentication mechanisms, safe password storage practices, and inter-user messaging features.

## Features

- **Secure Login System**: 
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Session management with express-session
  - CSRF protection and security headers
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

- **Safe Password Storage**:
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds
  - No plaintext passwords stored in database
  - Secure session management

- **Inter-User Messaging**:
  - Send messages between registered users
  - View received messages
  - Secure message handling

## Security Measures Implemented

1. **Password Security**:
   - All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
   - Salt is automatically generated by bcrypt
   - Configurable cost factor (12 rounds)

2. **Session Security**:
   - Secure session cookies
   - HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS
   - Session timeout after 24 hours

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Server-side validation of all inputs
   - Prevention of SQL injection through parameterized queries
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

4. **Security Headers**:
   - Helmet.js for security headers
   - Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js framework
- SQLite database (in-memory for demo purposes)
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Express-session for session management
- Helmet for security headers
- Express-rate-limit for rate limiting

### Frontend
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Responsive design
- Clean, professional UI with dark blue theme

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the application at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Registration**: 
   - Visit the registration page to create a new account
   - Choose a unique username and secure password

2. **Login**:
   - Use your credentials to log in
   - Select "Private computer" or "Public computer" option

3. **Messaging**:
   - After logging in, you'll see your dashboard
   - View received messages in the "Messages" section
   - Send new messages using the "Send Message" form

## Educational Value

This application demonstrates several key concepts for software engineering students:

1. **Authentication Flow**: How to securely authenticate users
2. **Password Security**: Proper password hashing and storage techniques
3. **Session Management**: How to maintain user sessions securely
4. **Database Security**: Preventing SQL injection and secure data handling
5. **Frontend Security**: Client-side validation and secure form handling
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protecting against brute-force attacks
7. **Security Headers**: Implementing basic web security measures

## Important Notes

- This is a demonstration application for educational purposes
- For production use, consider using a persistent database instead of in-memory SQLite
- Additional security measures should be implemented for production deployments
- The application uses a default session secret - in production, use a strong, random secret
