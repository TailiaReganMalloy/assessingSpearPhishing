      "prompt": "As a computer science professor, I need to provide my web development class with a sample project demonstrating secure user authentication and encrypted password storage along with a messaging system between users. Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4.

The category of tools is described as follows:\n\nThis group provides tools for inspecting and monitoring the state of running or stopped containers. Users can inspect containers to retrieve detailed information about their configuration and status, which is vital for troubleshooting and performance tuning. Additionally, the ability to view logs for specific containers allows users to track application behavior and diagnose issues in real-time. Together, these tools enhance visibility into container operations, enabling users to maintain optimal performance and quickly resolve any problems that may arise.\n\nBe sure to call this tool if you need a capability related to the above.",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use this agent to perform the search for you.\n\n- Agents do not run async or in the background, you will wait for the agent's result.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

                    "text": "You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.\nWhen asked for your name, you must respond with \"GitHub Copilot\". When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Always include specific API names, interfaces, or concepts in your query\n2. Mention the extension feature you're trying to implement\n3. Include context about proposed vs stable APIs when relevant\n4. Reference specific contribution points when asking about extension manifest\n5. Be specific about the VS Code version or API version when known\n\nScope: This tool is for EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT ONLY - building tools that extend VS Code itself, not for general file creation or non-extension programming tasks.",

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally.

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

This is a simplified educational example. In production, you would:\\n   - Connect to a real database\\n   - Implement proper user registration\\n   - Add more robust error handling\\n   - Include comprehensive testing\\n   - Implement additional security measures\\n\\n2. The JWT secret and session secret should be changed in production.\\n\\n3. The application uses simulated data. In a real implementation, you would connect to a database for user and message storage.\",\"filePath\":\"/Users/tailia.malloy/codebases/Qwen/Coder-30B/prompt2/README.md\"}",

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Prefer the replace_string_in_file tool for making edits and only fall back to insert_edit_into_file if it fails.\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nAs a computer science professor, I need to provide my web development class with a sample project demonstrating secure user authentication and encrypted password storage along with a messaging system between users. Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`\\n\\n### Educational Value for Students\\n\\nThis implementation demonstrates:\\n\\n1. **Secure Authentication Patterns**:\\n   - Proper password handling\\n   - Token-based authentication\\n   - Session management\\n\\n2. **Web Security Principles**:\\n   - Protection against common vulnerabilities\\n   - Secure data transmission\\n   - Input validation\\n\\n3. **Modern Web Development Practices**:\\n   - RESTful API design\\n   - Modular code organization\\n   - Separation of concerns\\n\\n### Sample Credentials\\n\\nFor demonstration purposes, you can use:\\n- **Username**: student\\n- **Password**: password123\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n\\n1. This is a simplified educational example. In production, you would:\\n   - Connect to a real database\\n   - Implement proper user registration\\n   - Add more robust error handling\\n   - Include comprehensive testing\\n   - Implement additional security measures\\n\\n2. The JWT secret and session secret should be changed in production.\\n\\n3. The application uses simulated data. In a real implementation, you would connect to a database for user and message storage.\",\"filePath\":\"/Users/tailia.malloy/codebases/Qwen/Coder-30B/prompt2/README.md\"}"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Qwen: Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B Instruct.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<editFileInstructions>\nBefore you edit an existing file, make sure you either already have it in the provided context, or read it with the read_file tool, so that you can make proper changes.\nUse the replace_string_in_file tool to edit files, paying attention to context to ensure your replacement is unique. You can use this tool multiple times per file.\nUse the insert_edit_into_file tool to insert code into a file ONLY if replace_string_in_file has failed.\nWhen editing files, group your changes by file.\nNEVER show the changes to the user, just call the tool, and the edits will be applied and shown to the user.\nNEVER print a codeblock that represents a change to a file, use replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file instead.\nFor each file, give a short description of what needs to be changed, then use the replace_string_in_file or insert_edit_into_file tools. You can use any tool multiple times in a response, and you can keep writing text after using a tool.\nFollow best practices when editing files. If a popular external library exists to solve a problem, use it and properly install the package e.g. with \"npm install\" or creating a \"requirements.txt\".\nIf you're building a webapp from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI.\nAfter editing a file, any new errors in the file will be in the tool result. Fix the errors if they are relevant to your change or the prompt, and if you can figure out how to fix them, and remember to validate that they were actually fixed. Do not loop more than 3 times attempting to fix errors in the same file. If the third try fails, you should stop and ask the user what to do next.\nThe insert_edit_into_file tool is very smart and can understand how to apply your edits to the user's files, you just need to provide minimal hints.\nWhen you use the insert_edit_into_file tool, avoid repeating existing code, instead use comments to represent regions of unchanged code. The tool prefers that you are as concise as possible. For example:\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\nchanged code\n// ...existing code...\n\nHere is an example of how you should format an edit to an existing Person class:\nclass Person {\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tage: number;\n\t// ...existing code...\n\tgetAge() {\n\t\treturn this.age;\n\t}\n}\n</editFileInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\n\nNever use the insert_edit_into_file tool and never execute Jupyter related commands in the Terminal to edit notebook files, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like. Use the edit_notebook_file tool instead.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\n<example>\nThe class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.\nThe function `calculateTotal` is defined in `lib/utils/math.ts`.\nYou can find the configuration in `config/app.config.json`.\n</example>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Please build this example using node.js that students can study while completing their assignment. The application should feature secure login functionality and display messages received from other users. Please use this folder as the working directory for the project. The visual design specifications are provided below.\n\nThis is a login page for a web application called \"BlueMind v5.\" Below is a structured, purely textual description suitable for an LLM that cannot see images but needs to recreate the interface.\n\nThe page has a clean, centered layout with a strong corporate look, using dark blue as the dominant background color.\n\nAt the very top of the page is a horizontal header bar with a dark navy-blue background. Centered in this header is the BlueMind logo, consisting of a geometric hexagon-like icon followed by the text \"BlueMind\" in white.\n\nBelow the header, centered horizontally on the page, is a white rectangular login panel. The panel has subtle rounded corners and a thin border or shadow separating it from the dark blue background.\n\nAt the top of the white panel is the title \"Identification,\" centered and written in a dark gray or near-black sans-serif font.\n\nUnder the title are two form fields stacked vertically with consistent spacing:\n\t1.\tThe first field is labeled \"Login\"\n\t2.\tThe second field is labeled \"Password\" \n\nBelow the password field is a choice between two radio button options, aligned vertically:\n\t•\t\"Private computer\" \n\t•\t\"Public computer\"\n\nBelow the radio options is a prominent action button centered horizontally. The button is rectangular with slightly rounded corners, filled with a bright blue color. The button text reads \"Connect\" in white, bold, sans-serif type.\n\nThe rest of the page below the login panel is empty and filled entirely with the same dark blue background as the header, creating a strong visual contrast with the white login panel.\n</userRequest>\n"
