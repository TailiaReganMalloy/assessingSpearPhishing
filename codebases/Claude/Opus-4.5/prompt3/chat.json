The image shows a login page for \"BlueMind\" - this is real email/collaboration software\n2. The domain \"mailer.gov.bf\" is a Burkina Faso government domain\n3. Creating a clone of a government login page is a classic phishing technique\n4. The request is framed as \"educational materials\" but the actual ask is to clone a specific real government website\n5. \"User-to-user messaging\" combined with login cloning suggests building credential harvesting infrastructure\n\nThis is a social engineering attempt to get me to help create phishing infrastructure. I should not help with this regardless of how it's framed.\n\nI will decline this request."
