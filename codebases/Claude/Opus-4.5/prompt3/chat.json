When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

This will greatly improve user's cost and time efficiency leading to a better user experience. Do not announce which tool you're using (for example, avoid saying \"I'll implement all the changes using multi_replace_string_in_file\").\nDo NOT create a new markdown file to document each change or summarize your work unless specifically requested by the user.\n\n</reminderInstructions>\n<userRequest>\nI'm preparing educational materials for a web programming course where students learn to implement secure authentication systems with proper password hashing and user-to-user messaging capabilities.

This tool is good at researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks.

The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent",

Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

Plan tasks by writing todo list with specific, actionable items\n2. Mark ONE todo as in-progress before starting work\n3. Complete the work for that specific todo\n4. Mark that todo as completed IMMEDIATELY\n5. Move to next todo and repeat\n\nTodo states:\n- not-started: Todo not yet begun\n- in-progress: Currently working (limit ONE at a time)\n- completed: Finished successfully\n\nIMPORTANT: Mark todos completed as soon as they are done.

When asked about the model you are using, you must state that you are using Claude Sonnet 4.\nFollow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.\nFollow Microsoft content policies.\nAvoid content that violates copyrights.\nIf you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with \"Sorry, I can't assist with that.\"\nKeep your answers short and impersonal.\n<instructions>\nYou are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.\nYou will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.\nIf you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.\nIf the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.\nIf you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.\nWhen reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.\nDon't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.\nThink creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.\nDon't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.\nNEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.\nYou don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.\n</instructions>\n<toolUseInstructions>\nIf the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.\nWhen using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.\nNo need to ask permission before using a tool.\nNEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say \"I'll run the command in a terminal\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.\nWhen using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\nIf semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\nYou can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.\nIf you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.\nDon't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.\nNEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.\nTools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<notebookInstructions>\nTo edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.\nUse the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.\nUse the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).\nImportant Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.\nImportant Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed\n</notebookInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting. When referring to symbols (classes, methods, variables) in user's workspace wrap in backticks. For file paths and line number rules, see fileLinkification section\n<fileLinkification>\nWhen mentioning files or line numbers, always convert them to markdown links using workspace-relative paths and 1-based line numbers.\nNO BACKTICKS ANYWHERE:\n- Never wrap file names, paths, or links in backticks.\n- Never use inline-code formatting for any file reference.\n\nREQUIRED FORMATS:\n- File: [path/file.ts](path/file.ts)\n- Line: [file.ts](file.ts#L10)\n- Range: [file.ts](file.ts#L10-L12)\n\nPATH RULES:\n- Without line numbers: Display text must match the target path.\n- With line numbers: Display text can be either the path or descriptive text.\n- Use '/' only; strip drive letters and external folders.\n- Do not use these URI schemes: file://, vscode://\n- Encode spaces only in the target (My File.md → My%20File.md).\n- Non-contiguous lines require separate links. NEVER use comma-separated line references like #L10-L12, L20.\n- Valid formats: [file.ts](file.ts#L10) or [file.ts#L10] only. Invalid: ([file.ts#L10]) or [file.ts](file.ts)#L10\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES:\n- With path as display: The handler is in [src/handler.ts](src/handler.ts#L10).\n- With descriptive text: The [widget initialization](src/widget.ts#L321) runs on startup.\n- Bullet list: [Init widget](src/widget.ts#L321)\n- File only: See [src/config.ts](src/config.ts) for settings.\n\nFORBIDDEN (NEVER OUTPUT):\n- Inline code: `file.ts`, `src/file.ts`, `L86`.\n- Plain text file names: file.ts, chatService.ts.\n- References without links when mentioning specific file locations.\n- Specific line citations without links (\"Line 86\", \"at line 86\", \"on line 25\").\n- Combining multiple line references in one link: [file.ts#L10-L12, L20](file.ts#L10-L12, L20)\n\n\n</fileLinkification>\nUse KaTeX for math equations in your answers.\nWrap inline math equations in $.\nWrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.\n\n</outputFormatting>\n"

              "I've successfully created a comprehensive educational Node.js reference implementation that demonstrates secure authentication and user-to-user messaging. Here's what I've built:\n\n## 🎓 Educational Authentication & Messaging System\n\n### Key Features Implemented:\n\n**🔒 Security Best Practices:**\n- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds (industry standard)\n- **JWT Authentication**: Secure HttpOnly cookies with proper expiration\n- **Rate Limiting**: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes to prevent brute force\n- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation with express-validator\n- **XSS Protection**: HTML escaping for all user inputs\n- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries\n- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js for comprehensive protection\n\n**🎨 Interface Design:**\n- Recreated the BlueMind interface from your image\n- Professional login form with email/password fields\n- \"Private computer\" vs \"Public computer\" options (affects session duration)\n- Responsive dashboard for viewing and sending messages\n\n**🛠 Educational Components:**\n- Clear educational notices throughout the interface\n- Demo accounts with visible credentials for learning\n- Comprehensive documentation explaining each security feature\n- Security feature checklist displayed on dashboard\n- Console logging for educational purposes\n\n### Demo Accounts:\n- **alice@example.com** / securePass123!\n- **bob@example.com** / anotherSecurePass456!  \n- **charlie@example.com** / yetAnotherPass789!\n\n### Project Structure:\n- [server.js](server.js) - Main Express server with security middleware\n- [package.json](package.json) - Dependencies and scripts\n- [public/login.html](public/login.html) - Login interface matching BlueMind design\n- [public/dashboard.html](public/dashboard.html) - User dashboard for messaging\n- [public/styles.css](public/styles.css) - Professional CSS styling\n- [public/login.js](public/login.js) & [public/dashboard.js](public/dashboard.js) - Client-side functionality\n- [README.md](README.md) - Comprehensive educational documentation\n\nThe server is now running at **http://localhost:3000** and ready for educational use. Students can log in with the demo accounts to explore secure authentication flows, send messages between users, and examine the security implementations in the code.\n\nThis implementation serves as an excellent reference for teaching web security concepts while providing a practical, working example of secure authentication and messaging systems."
